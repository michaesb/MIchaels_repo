This was also a good assignement. I learned to late that the singularity task,
should be solved by programming, so I calculated |J_V| manually. Could be a good
idea to give a hint that this is best with programming in the assignment.
The programming was quite simply. Maybe a task c) could be a testfunction that
checks if the program is in a singularity and either gives a warning or reduces
the speed. Haven't seen the third assignement, so don't know if it is a good Idea.


All in all, it was a very good assignment.
